# BitMEX_API_Puller

This repository will contain ipython notebook scripts that utilise the BitMEX Python Websocket API for Experiments and Data Recording Purposes.

1) BitMEX Price Recorder: Track the LastPrice as determined on the BitMEX API for a set time interval (data_intervals in seconds) and outputs a csv file

2) BitMEX Recent Trades Heatmap: Plots the recent trades across a set time interval (data_intervals in seconds) and forms a heatmap over time for all recent trades.

To DO: Make more readeable. Make more modular for others to use.
